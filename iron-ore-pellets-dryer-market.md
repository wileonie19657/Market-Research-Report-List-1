<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Iron Ore Pellets Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Heat Exchange</li><li>Indirect Heat Exchange</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Iron Ore Pellets Dryer market is segmented into two main types based on the heat exchange method: direct heat exchange and indirect heat exchange. </p><p>In direct heat exchange, hot gases are directly introduced into the dryer, providing quick and efficient heat transfer but potentially exposing the pellets to contaminants. </p><p>In contrast, indirect heat exchange involves heating surfaces that transfer heat to the pellets without direct contact with combustion gases, ensuring cleaner output while generally being more energy-intensive. Both methods aim to optimize moisture removal from iron ore pellets for enhanced processing efficiency.</p></p>
