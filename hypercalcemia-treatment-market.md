<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hypercalcemia Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bisphosphonates</li><li>Glucocorticoids</li><li>Calcimimetic Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hypercalcemia treatment market comprises several key categories, including bisphosphonates, glucocorticoids, and calcimimetic agents. Bisphosphonates help reduce calcium release from bones, making them effective for conditions like malignancy-related hypercalcemia. Glucocorticoids, anti-inflammatory agents, mitigate elevated calcium levels, particularly in conditions like hypercalcemia due to malignancy or certain autoimmune diseases. Calcimimetic agents enhance the sensitivity of calcium-sensing receptors, lowering parathyroid hormone levels and calcium release. Together, these treatments address various underlying causes of hypercalcemia, improving patient outcomes.</p></p>
