<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy-duty Vehicle Engine Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compression Release Brake</li><li>Exhaust Brake</li><li>Retarder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heavy-duty vehicle engine brake market features three main types: Compression Release Brakes, Exhaust Brakes, and Retarders. Compression Release Brakes utilize the engine's compression cycle to slow the vehicle, enhancing control and reducing brake wear. Exhaust Brakes restrict exhaust flow, creating back pressure to assist in deceleration without additional wear on traditional brakes. Retarders, often integrated into the driveline, provide continuous braking force, improving safety on long descents. These technologies collectively enhance braking efficiency and vehicle safety.</p></p>
