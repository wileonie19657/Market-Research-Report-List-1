<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vertical Launch System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Launch</li><li>Cold Launch</li><li>Concentric Canister Launch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Vertical Launch System (VLS) market is categorized into three main types: Hot Launch, Cold Launch, and Concentric Canister Launch. Hot Launch involves igniting the rocket’s engines while still within the launch platform, providing immediate thrust. Cold Launch uses a gas generator to eject the missile or rocket before ignition, minimizing heat impact on the launch platform. Concentric Canister Launch employs a cylindrical design where multiple missiles can be stored in a single canister, maximizing space and efficiency in deployment.</p></p>
