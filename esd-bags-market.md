<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ESD Bags Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conductive and Dissipative Polymers</li><li>Metal</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ESD bags market consists of three primary types: conductive polymers, dissipative polymers, and metal. Conductive polymers provide a path for static charge to flow, preventing damage to sensitive electronics. Dissipative polymers, on the other hand, manage static electricity by gradually dissipating charges instead of allowing sudden discharge. Metal ESD bags offer high protection through their metallic layers, reflecting static and electromagnetic interference. Other types may include blended materials and specialized packaging solutions tailored for specific electronic components.</p></p>
