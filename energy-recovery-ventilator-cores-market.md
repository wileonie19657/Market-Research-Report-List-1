<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Energy Recovery Ventilator Cores Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Crossflow</li><li>Counter-flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV) cores are essential components in ventilation systems, facilitating heat and moisture transfer between incoming and outgoing air streams. In the crossflow type, two air streams pass each other horizontally through the core, maximizing surface area for heat exchange but allowing minimal moisture transfer. In contrast, counter-flow cores position the incoming and outgoing air streams parallel in opposite directions, enhancing thermal and moisture recovery efficiency due to their design, making them ideal for various HVAC applications.</p></p>
