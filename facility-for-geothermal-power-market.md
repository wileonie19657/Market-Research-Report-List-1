<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Facility for Geothermal Power Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flash System</li><li>Binary Cycle System</li><li>Dry Steam System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The geothermal power market consists of three main types: </p><p>1. **Flash System**: This method uses high-pressure steam from geothermal reservoirs. As the steam is brought to the surface, it "flashes" into vapor, driving turbine generators.</p><p>2. **Binary Cycle System**: This system transfers heat from geothermal hot water to a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point, causing it to vaporize and drive a turbine.</p><p>3. **Dry Steam System**: This utilizes steam extracted directly from geothermal reservoirs to power turbines, making it the simplest and most efficient method. Each type offers unique advantages based on resource availability and project scale.</p></p>
